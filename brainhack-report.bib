    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Neurons in the visual cortex form spatial representations or maps of several stimulus features. How are different spatial representations of visual information coordinated in the brain? In this paper, we study the hypothesis that the coordinated organization of several visual cortical maps can be explained by joint optimization. Previous attempts to explain the spatial layout of functional maps in the visual cortex proposed specific optimization principles ad hoc. Here, we systematically analyze how optimization principles in a general class of models impact on the spatial layout of visual cortical maps. For each considered optimization principle we identify the corresponding optima and analyze their spatial layout. This directly demonstrates that by studying map layout and geometric inter-map correlations one can substantially constrain the underlying optimization principle. In particular, we study whether such optimization principles can lead to spatially complex patterns and to geometric correlations among cortical maps as observed in imaging experiments.</p>},

ABSTRACT={Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source software projectfor the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)experiments. dMRI is an application of MRI that can be used to measurestructural features of brain white matter.  Many methods have been developed touse dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiberbundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of thebrain.Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including:diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions inindividual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysisand visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations forall the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface.We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as thediffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition,cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such asconstrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging withdeconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and originalmethods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions areprovided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as wellas file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of noveltechniques.In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not beingdeveloped by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project thatencourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and opendiscussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has aninternational team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutionsin five countries and three continents, which is still growing.}}

abstract = "Diffusion \{MRI\} streamlines tractography suffers from a number of inherent limitations, one of which is the accurate determination of when streamlines should be terminated. Use of an accurate streamlines propagation mask from segmentation of an anatomical image confines the streamlines to the volume of the brain white matter, but does not take full advantage of all of the information available from such an image. We present a modular addition to streamlines tractography, which makes more effective use of the information available from anatomical image segmentation, and the known properties of the neuronal axons being reconstructed, to apply biologically realistic priors to the streamlines generated; we refer to this as “Anatomically-Constrained Tractography”. Results indicate that some of the known false positives associated with tractography algorithms are prevented, such that the biological accuracy of the reconstructions should be improved, provided that state-of-the-art streamlines tractography methods are used.
