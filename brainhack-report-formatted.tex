\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

To implement an image segmentation algorithm in DIPY
\cite{Garyfallidis2014} for classifying the different tissue types of
the brain using structural T1 images and diffusion MRI images (dMRI) as
well as to incorporate tissue probability maps for
Anatomically-constrained tractography (ACT) \cite{Smith20121924}.

DMRI is used for creating visual representations of the structural
connectivity of the brain, also known as tractography. Research has
shown that using a tissue classifier can be of great benefit to create
more accurate representations of the underlying connections
\cite{Girard2014}.

\section{Approach}\label{approach}

We used a Bayesian approach for the segmentation
\cite{Zhang2001,Avants2011} by applying the Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP)
procedure. The prior probability was modeled with Markov Random Fields
(MRF). The MRF distribution was modeled as a Gibbs distribution. We used
the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to update the tissue labels
at each site and to update the parameters of the log-likelihood in all
iterations.

\section{Results}\label{results}

The first row of the figure shows an example T1 structural image, the
initial segmentation and the final segmentation after 12 iterations and
beta=0.01. Beta determines the weight of the neighborhood in the MRF
model. The second row shows the probability maps of the three main
tissue classes of the brain. These maps were used in the ACT algorithm
and improved fiber tracking.

  \caption{\label{centfig} Example segmentations.}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

We developed a segmentation algorithm based on a Bayesian framework by
using the MAP-MRF approach and EM. The algorithm was tested on
T1-weighted images as well as on dMRI derived maps, such as the
Diffusion Power Maps (DPM) \cite{Dell2014}. The tissue specific
probability maps from both the T1 and the DPMs were then used for ACT.
